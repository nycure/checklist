# 9-Day Study Plan Checklist (MTE Exam: 2 Nov 2025)

Complete study plan for ADSA, Communication & Aptitude, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, System Design, and TOC. 
- **Schedule**: 24 Oct → 1 Nov (9 days)
- **Daily commitment**: 9 hours (3 sessions × 3 hours each)
- **Coverage**: 100% of syllabus verified ✓

Files:
- `index.html` — main UI

6. Use "Export JSON" to back up progress. Use "Import JSON" to restore.
7. "Reset All" clears all progress (confirmation required).

Coverage:
- ✓ All ADSA topics (complexity, arrays, linked lists, stacks, recursion, queues, heap, hashing, trees)
- ✓ All Communication & Aptitude topics (grammar, vocab, set theory, syllogism, P&C, probability, LR, DI)
- ✓ All Deep Learning topics (Unit I & II: perceptron, MLP, activations, loss, backprop, optimization, regularization, metrics)
- ✓ All Machine Learning topics (fundamentals, regression, classification, SVM, clustering, RL, GA, comparisons)
- ✓ All System Design topics (requirements, SDLC, SA/SD, OOA/OOD, scaling, load balancers, databases, storage)
- ✓ All TOC topics (DFA, NFA, epsilon, Moore/Mealy, regular expressions, minimization, grammars, pumping lemma)

Notes:
- This is local-only: no data leaves your machine unless you export and share the file.
- Works offline.
- Session notes use exact syllabus wording for accurate exam prep.
